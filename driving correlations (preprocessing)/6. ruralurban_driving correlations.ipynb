    "These functions were then used to plot a variety of different graphs to visualize the driving data, and specifically the correlations it may have to location of residence (i.e. whether there is a difference between rural and urban participants in some driving behaviour/attribute). RUplot_comparative was used to compare plots from the NC, STL, and overall datasets to determine if there was any significant differences between the NC and STL datasets (e.g. even though they share some attributes, the data for these attributes may have been collected in different ways, thus making them uncomparable and indicating that they should not be combined in the overall dataset). RUplot was used to create individual plots as desired (e.g. for attributes that were not shared between datasets), and RUplot_multiplefeatures was used to create multiple plots for the same feature and dataset as desired. Plots were also seperately made to compare the coding types used in this project (RUCA_ru, other_ru, and overall RU code) but without many significant differences observed.\n",
